# 🔧 Production Admin Panel Fix

## 🚨 **Issue**: 
- Admin panel showing "Unexpected token '<'" error
- Images not loading in production

## ✅ **Solution**:

### **Step 1: Use New Production Deployment Script**
```bash
# SSH to EC2 and run:
cd /home/ec2-user/ayurvedic-ecommerce
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

### **Step 2: What This Fixes**:
1. **Admin Panel**: Now served as static files instead of proxy (fixes JS errors)
2. **Images**: Proper CORS headers and caching for uploads
3. **React Router**: Proper fallback to index.html for all routes

### **Key Changes**:
- ✅ Admin panel served directly by nginx (no PM2 proxy)
- ✅ Proper React Router handling with `try_files`
- ✅ Image CORS headers fixed
- ✅ Static asset caching enabled

### **Production URLs** (After Fix):
- **Client**: https://learnonai.com ✅
- **Admin**: https://learnonai.com:8080 ✅ (Fixed!)
- **API**: https://learnonai.com/api ✅
- **Images**: https://learnonai.com/uploads/ ✅ (Fixed!)

### **Why This Works**:
The "Unexpected token '<'" error happens when React tries to load JS files but gets HTML (404 page) instead. By serving admin panel as static files with proper nginx configuration, all assets load correctly.

## 🖼️ **Images Issue**:
All product images are already in `/backend/uploads/` and will be accessible at `https://learnonai.com/uploads/` after deployment.

## 🧪 **Test After Deployment**:
1. Visit https://learnonai.com:8080 - Should load admin panel
2. Login with admin@ayurveda.com / admin123
3. Check products page - Images should load
4. Visit https://learnonai.com - Client should show products with images
